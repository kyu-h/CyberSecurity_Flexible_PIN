# CyberSecurity_Flexible_PIN

Although the PIN method using the touchpad has been used in many fields due to its convenience, the keypad that has been introduced is vulnerable to many kinds of attacks. In the case of door locks most commonly used in the market, the most commonly used one-dimensional problem is that the ovaries are worn out, and not the special attack method, but the worn-out area enables password analogy. To solve this problem, various methods such as randomly displaying the numbers are introduced, but this is also not completely safe. The common feature of all the solutions so far is that the keypad area is fixed. In this paper, we consider that point in reverse and create a new area smaller than the entire area in the entire area of the keypad, causing the keypad of the new area to move randomly, preventing the password from being guessed. This technique first suggests a new type of keypad that transforms the touch area, which is easier to use than the random numeric keypad, even on the user side, since the number of the keypad is left unchanged and the shoulder surfing attack is impossible. <br>
